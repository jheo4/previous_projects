# PyGame Game Development

I start this project for fun. When I learn a new programming language, I usually make a game for getting used to use the new language. For [StarCraft2 AI project](https://jin993.github.io/project/sc2AI/sc2ai){: target="_blank"}, I'v studied Python, and I also start to make a game with Python. 
The game, Jin Fighting Game, is a kind of fighting games with networks. The server program is also posted, so it is possible to build new server when somebody wants to do it.
