# The StarCraft II API Has Arrived

[News link](http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/blog/20944009/the-starcraft-ii-api-has-arrived-8-9-2017){: target="_blank"}

Blizzard Entertainment released the starcraft 2 API in Aug 2017. Following this news, the API has these features.

- Scripted AI API
- Image-based AI API (feature layers)
- Documentation, sample code, and sample bots
- Support for offline AI vs. AI play
- A replay pack of anonymized 1v1 ladder games
- Windows and Mac support
- Fully-featured Linux package of the API

The API is released on github.
- [StarCraft II API Library](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-api)
- [StarCraft II API Protocol](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto)
- [Python Protocol Binding Library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/s2clientprotocol/)

I think Image-based AI API is what I need in this project. Until now, I shold check more about the API. I also consider to use scripted AI API with some tasks. I think the hybrid way is quite good for making AI.
